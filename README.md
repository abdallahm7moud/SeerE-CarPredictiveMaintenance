# SeerE - Predictive Car Malfunction Detection (Graduation Project)

## 📋 Project Overview
**SeerE** is a predictive maintenance system developed as part of my **Graduation Project**. It is designed to anticipate car malfunctions before they occur by leveraging real-time sensor data collected via an OBD-II device. Using machine learning models, SeerE analyzes patterns, detects anomalies, and predicts potential mechanical failures to enhance vehicle safety, minimize unexpected breakdowns, and optimize maintenance schedules.

## 🚗 Features
- Real-time data extraction from vehicle sensors using OBD-II devices
- Preprocessing and analysis of key sensor metrics (e.g., RPM, engine temperature, throttle position)
- Predictive machine learning models to detect early signs of malfunction
- Health monitoring dashboards and alerts for users
- Flexible architecture for integration with mobile apps or fleet management systems

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python for development
- OBD-II communication libraries (e.g., python-OBD)
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Flask or Streamlit for dashboard (optional)

## 📈 How It Works
### Data Collection:
- Connect to the car's OBD-II port and extract real-time sensor data.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Clean, normalize, and engineer features from raw sensor readings.

### Model Training:
- Train machine learning models on historical data to classify normal vs. faulty patterns.

### Prediction and Monitoring:
- Continuously monitor incoming data and predict the likelihood of malfunctions.

### Alerts and Reporting:
- Notify users when a potential issue is detected based on prediction thresholds.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SeerE.git
   cd SeerE
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Connect your OBD-II device and configure settings if necessary.
4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Expand dataset with a wider variety of vehicle types and fault scenarios
- Deploy real-time mobile notifications
- Integrate advanced deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series data)
- Support multiple OBD-II protocols and adapters
- Add automatic model retraining based on newly collected data
